# ProntoHex

Inspired by https://github.com/probonopd/ProntoHex, This is a almost completely re-write of the library to be faster, more effeciant and be able to handle any length of pronto hex.

This Arduino library is used to convert Pronto Hex to raw timings, frequency and length. It can be used with a variaty of IR send libraries like [Arduino-IRremote](https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote) and [IRremoteESP8266](https://github.com/sebastienwarin/IRremoteESP8266)
